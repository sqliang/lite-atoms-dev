"""PostgreSQL helpers; transactions must remain shorter than model/build execution.

A process-level pool avoids paying a fresh TCP+TLS handshake to the managed Postgres
on every query — on slow networks that handshake dominated API latency. Connections
are checked before reuse because Supabase closes idle ones.
